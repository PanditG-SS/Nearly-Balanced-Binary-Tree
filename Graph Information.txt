Graph 1 :
Total time required for insertion of values from i = 1 to i = n as a function of n log2 n where n is a multiple of 5×104 and n≤107. 
The value of n starts from 5*10^4.

Graph 2 :
Time taken for the ith insertion as a function of i where 1e5 ≤ i ≤ 1e6 .
SCALE : ON X-AXIS :1 UNIT: 0.1 X 10^6 ON Y-AXIS: 1 UNIT: 0.001 SECOND
